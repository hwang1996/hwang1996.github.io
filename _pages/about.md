I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of the AI Thrust at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/). I received my Ph.D. at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, supervised by [Prof. Miao Chun Yan](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00084) and [Prof. Guosheng Lin](https://guosheng.github.io). I also work closely with [Prof. Steven Hoi](https://sites.google.com/view/stevenhoi/home). I was an intern working with [Jiashi Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/jshfeng/home) at TikTok, Singapore.

My general research interests lie in the development of AI-powered perception and generation algorithms for multimodal data, including text, images, videos, and 3D shapes. Recently, we are working on projects of <font color=RoyalBlue>3D reconstruction</font> and <font color=RoyalBlue>LLM-based agents</font>. Please drop me an email if you are interested in collaborations.


<font color=RoyalBlue>I am looking for self-motivated PhD students, RAs and interns.</font>
