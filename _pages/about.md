I am currently a final year PhD candidate at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, supervised by [Prof. Miao Chun Yan](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00084) and [Prof. Guosheng Lin](https://guosheng.github.io). I also work closely with [Prof. Steven Hoi](https://sites.google.com/view/stevenhoi/home). During my PhD study, I did one-year internship at TikTok, Singapore, advised by [Jiashi Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/jshfeng/home). Prior to that, I received my B.E. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China. 


<p style="color:red;"> I will join the AI Thrust at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) as a tenure-track Assistant Professor. 
I am looking for self-motivated PhD students, RAs and interns. Please feel free to drop me an email if you are interested.
