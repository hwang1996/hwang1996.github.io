I received my Ph.D. at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, supervised by [Prof. Miao Chun Yan](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00084) and [Prof. Guosheng Lin](https://guosheng.github.io). I also work closely with [Prof. Steven Hoi](https://sites.google.com/view/stevenhoi/home). I was an intern working with [Jiashi Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/jshfeng/home) at TikTok, Singapore. Prior to my Ph.D., I received my B.E. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology. 

My primary research interests lie in the development of AI-powered perception and generation algorithms for multimodal data, including text, images, videos, and 3D shapes. Particularly, my work involves investigating various deep learning approaches on visual-to-text generation, controllable visual content generation, and cross-modal retrieval.


I will join the AI Thrust at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/) as a tenure-track Assistant Professor. <font color=RoyalBlue>I am looking for self-motivated PhD students, RAs and interns.</font> Please check my [recruitment page](https://wanghao.tech/recruitment/).
