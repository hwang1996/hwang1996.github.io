I am currently a final year Ph.D. candidate at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, supervised by [Prof. Miao Chun Yan](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00084) and [Prof. Guosheng Lin](https://guosheng.github.io). I also work closely with [Prof. Steven Hoi](https://sites.google.com/view/stevenhoi/home). I was an intern working with [Jiashi Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/jshfeng/home) at TikTok, Singapore. Prior to my Ph.D., I received my B.E. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2018. 

My primary research interests lie in the development of AI-powered perception and generation algorithms for multimodal data, including text, images, videos, and 3D shapes. Particularly, my work involves investigating various deep learning approaches on visual-to-text generation, controllable visual content generation and cross-modal retrieval.


<p style="color:red;"> I will join the AI Thrust at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) as a tenure-track Assistant Professor. 
I am looking for self-motivated PhD students, RAs and interns starting from Fall 2023. Please feel free to drop me an email if you are interested.
